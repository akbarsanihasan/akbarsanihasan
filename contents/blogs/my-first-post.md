## My post

This is my first post. This post were originally intended to be a testing for
the visual of the blog post. but i decided to keep it just because.

## Confession

The above sentence are basically the same as my excerpt. because i don't even
know what an excerpt is or any other terms for a blog post or article. I
intended to do some research on this topic later on.

As a matter a fact my writing skills are comparable to a 3 year old toddler who
learn what an elephant is (this simile doesn't make any sense, and i don't even
know what simile is, i had to ask to chatgpt)

## My cat names

To make this blog post longer i've decided to list all my late cats

1. Impus
2. Cecep
3. Magenta
4. Bagong (he was the fat one)
