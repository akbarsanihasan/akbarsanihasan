                <p>
                    I am villager equipped with programming skills that always
                    trying to prioritize performance, simplicity, and
                    colalboration freedom. Prioritizing performance is not
                    always easy and the fun part about programming but i believe
                    it's necessary and it will mold someone into better
                    programmer. Unecessary complexity are the roots of
                    unproductive software engineer and by glamorizing simplicity
                    i believe it's the way for developing software faster and
                    more predictable.
                </p>
                <h5 class="heading text-bold text-display">* Personal life</h5>
                <h6>Background</h6>
                <p>
                    I grew up in a village that aren't so rural because Pizza
                    Hut and KFC are probably 5 minute away on motorcycle. We
                    don't own computer until my second sister entered highscool,
                    we don't have wifi after i graduate my Vocational School. If
                    i could describe my family economic state is that we are at
                    the very bottom of the middle class, we could only afford
                    entry level tertiary needs.
                </p>
                <h6>Educations</h6>
                <p>
                    I attend 4year Vocational School studying <i>Programming</i
                    >, <i>Computer Architecture</i>, <i>System as a Service</i>, <i
                        >Infrascturcture as a Service</i
                    >, <i>Platform as a Service</i> and <i>Cyber Security</i>.
                    That sounds like an ambitious school programs, and it's
                    true, the only subject that i could fully picked up is
                    programming because in the end it was all self thought and
                    there are many material i can worked with out there on the
                    internet than in school.

                <p>
                    I like watching movies and tv just like any normal human

                <span class="text-bold">** Sports</span>
                <p>
                    I am not a sports guy and i am not athletic, but lately i
                    have been interested in <i>Running</i> and <i
                        >Bodyweight exercise</i
                    > and looking forward to be consistent at it and also i have
                    been following the Formula 1 since 2023 season, i am cheering
                    for <span

                    >, a fallen legend teams slowly climbing to regain their
                    dominance in the sports is quite satisfying to cheer.

                <p>
                    I am currently on hiatus from video games but i have played
                    several games in the past such <i>Far cry</i>, <i
                        >Call of duty: Modern warefare</i
                    >, and <i>Stardew valley</i> and some online mobile games but
                    i have fully given up on them long ago.
